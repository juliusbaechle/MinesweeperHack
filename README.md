Hack that finishes Minesweeper on pressing '1' on the numpad.
Following the Udemy-Course "Reverse Engineering: Ghidra for Beginners" by Paul Chin I reverse-engineered 
Minesweeper until I found the address of the `void endGame(int a_won)` function. After that, it was 
easy to write a .dll that calls this function after its injection:
```C++
void endGame(int a_won) {
  typedef void (*__stdcall pFunctionAddress)(int);
  pFunctionAddress pMySecretFunction = (pFunctionAddress)(0x0100347c);
  pMySecretFunction(a_won);
}
```
I admit it's the most fragile code I've ever written. It works though ðŸ˜…
